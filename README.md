# Sear: A Text Based Adventure

To start a journey is to start at the beginning. This is to be a Zork clone, with our own twists and features. 

Rules:

1. Text only! Get your creative juices flowing.
2. Everyone participate at least in some way!
3. We can finish this within three months. That gives us a season. Let's finish this by the solstice - June 21st.
